			<p>The sea otter (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of 
			the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh 
			between 14 and 45 kg (31 and 99 lb), making them the heaviest members of the 
			weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, 
			the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, 
			the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter 
			lives mostly in the ocean.</p>
